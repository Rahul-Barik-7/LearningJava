what is abstraction :
-----------------------
>> The process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user is called abstraction 

>> We can achieve abstraction 2 ways 
   1) using Abstract class (by using abstract class we cannot achieve 100% abstraction)
   2) using interface concept (by using interface we can achieve 100% abstraction)
   
   
   Interface
   ---------------
   >> its a blue print of the class
   >> interface contains static and final variable by-default
   >> interface contains abstract method (also allowed default methods and static methods from java8 onwards)
   >> abstract method is method which contains only method signature but not implementation or unimplemented method
   >> methods in interface are public  by-default
   >> the time of implement abstract method in the child class the method should be public 
   >> interface supports multiple inheritance
   >> class-class -extends
   >> interface-interface -extends
   >> interface-class - implements 
   >> we can create object reference for interface but we can not instantiate interface (we can not object for interface)
   
   why we create the abstract method inside interface and what is the use and who will implement this method
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   >> because developer do not know how to implement before design part is not done , only know the requirement and as per the requirement he will create 
      the abstract method and later he will implement inside another class
