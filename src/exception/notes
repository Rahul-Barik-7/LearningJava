exception Handling
---------------------
Exception:
>> Exception is an event which will cause the program termination

types of exception 
-------------------
Checked Exception:
-------------------
>> The exception which are identified by java compiler
Example: FileNotFpoundException
		 IOException etc
>>Checked Exception we can handled in 2 ways
		1) using try and catch block 
		2) using throws keyword


Unchecked Exception:
-------------------
>> The exception which are not identified by java compiler
Example: ArithmaticException
		 NullpointerException
		 ArrayindexOutOfBoundsExcception
>>UnChecked Exception we can handled only one ways i.e by using try catch 

When: 
-----
>> Whenever you will pass the invalid input to the server then you might get Exception

Notes* 
-------
>> one try block can have multiple catch block for that  whichever exception it will match  but one problem is if the exception is not match then 
>> if you don't know which exception it will throw then you can mention parent class Exception like (catch(Exception e)) because Exception class is the parent 
   exception class for all the exception class
 
Finally
----------
>>case-1(Exception occurred, catch block handled - finally block will execute )
>>case-2(Exception occurred, catch block not handled - finally block will execute )
>>case-3(Exception not occurred, catch block skipped - finally block will execute )

>>try catch is a statement level and throws is method level
