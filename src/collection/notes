collection
--------------
1. A collection in Java is a group of objects stored in a single unit.
2. it is an interface which is present inside java.utils package
3. The Java Collections Framework (JCF) provides standard implementations of common data structures and algorithms.

Why Use Collections?
------------------------
Efficiently store, retrieve, and manipulate data.
Reduce the need for custom data structures.
Provide type safety and generic support.
Improve performance using optimized algorithms.

ArrayList
--------
-ArrayList is a class which is implemented list interface.
its supports:
1. Heterogeneous data allowed
2. Insertion order allowed means indexing is allowed
3. Duplicate element allowed
4. Accepts multiple nulls

HashSet
----------
HashSet is a class which is implemented set interface.
its supports:
1. Heterogeneous data allowed
2. Insertion order  not allowed means indexing not supported 
3. Duplicate element not allowed
4. multiple nulls are not allowed /only single allowed

Note:-- Depends upon the nature of the data we have to select collection type


Map interface
---------------
In the map interface you can store the data by the form of key and values 
HashMap:- is a class which is implemented Map collection.
1. the combination of key and values is called one pairs
2. key should not be duplicate again but the value can duplicate , if you will add duplicate key then it will replace the old value 
3. Insertion order  not allowed means indexing not supported
4. When should prefer - when you have the data in the form of key and values (Example: key: browser , values:edge)
