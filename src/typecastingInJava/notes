TypeCasting 
---------
>> Converting one type of data into another type is called type casting
>> We have 2types of type casting 
>> We can do casting for primitive type and also object type 

	1) Up-casting / Widening (converting the value from smaller to larger type)	
			>> its a automatic process 
			>> implicitly we have to do
	2) Down-casting / Narrowing (converting the value from Larger to smaller type)
			>> its a manually process 
			>> there may be chances for data lose
			>> explicitly we have to do
